# Data Mining Coding Assignments

## [HW 1](https://github.com/Amirhossein-Rajabpour/Data-Mining-Assignments/blob/main/DM_HW1.ipynb)
In this assignment `iris` dataset was used and it was mainly about preprocessing and normalizing the data using famous libraries such as `pandas` and `scikit-learn`. After that `PCA` algorithm is used to reduce the dimmension of the data. <br>

## [HW 2](https://github.com/Amirhossein-Rajabpour/Data-Mining-Assignments/blob/main/DM_HW2.ipynb)
This assignment was mainly about working with `Tensorflow` for creating different neaural networks to work with `make circles` and `fashion mnist` datasets.

## HW 3
### [Part 1: Clustering](https://github.com/Amirhossein-Rajabpour/Data-Mining-Assignments/blob/main/Clustering.ipynb)
This notebook is mostly palying with `k-means` clustering algorithm and use it for reducing the size of an image. Also we wored `DBSCAN` algorithm and tuned its parameters.

### [Part 2: Association Rules](https://github.com/Amirhossein-Rajabpour/Data-Mining-Assignments/blob/main/AssociationRules.ipynb)
`Association Rules` were extracted from `Hypermarket_dataset` dataset using `Apriori` algorithm.
